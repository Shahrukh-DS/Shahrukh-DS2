# NASA Turbofan Engine RUL Prediction

This project uses predictive lung cancer using the lun cancner dataset.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Data Source**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/62/lung+cancer
- **File**: `lung_code.ipynb` (Google Colab Notebook)

## 📌 Key Features

- Data loading and preprocessing from multiple file types
- Feature engineering to compute RUL
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Trees
  - SVM
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall F1 Score
- Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
- Feature importance analysis for tree-based models


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

### Running the Notebook

1. Upload the dataset folder `CMaps` containing:
   - `lung_cancer.csv'

2. Open `lung_code.ipynb` in Colab or Jupyter.

3. Run all cells.
